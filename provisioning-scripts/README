# Scripts for Provisioning and Managing Nectar Virtual Machines

## Pre-requisites

To run any of the scripts in this folder, you will first need to set your Nectar keys (EC2 Key and Secret) as an
environment variable. This is important as we cannot have this sensitive information over our public git repository

To get your access key and secret, follow the steps below:
+ login to nector cloud at: https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/project/
+ Navigate to "Access & Security" from the left-sidebar
+ At the top, navigate to "API Access"
+ Then select the "View Credentials" from the top-left buttons
+ Copy the EC2 Access Key and Secret safely somewhere (NEVER share this over public internet as anyone can
        access our machines using these credentials

Once you have the key and secret, you need to set it as your environment variables:

### Ubuntu and Unix
If you are using Ubuntu, just run the following commands on your terminal
```bash
export ENV_KEY='your_ec2_key'
export ENV_SECRET='your_ec2_secret'
```

These two commands will set your environment variables but will only be valid for that terminal session.
You can add these two commands in your `~/.bashrc` file if you want them to be loaded everytime the terminal
opens up
